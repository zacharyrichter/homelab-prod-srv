Komodo is a web app to provide structure for managing your servers, builds, deployments, and automated procedures.

With Komodo you can:

Connect all of your servers, alert on CPU usage, memory usage, and disk usage, and connect to shell sessions. 

Create, start, stop, and restart Docker containers on the connected servers, view their status and logs, and connect to container shell. 

Deploy docker compose stacks. The file can be defined in UI, or in a git repo, with auto deploy on git push. 

Build application source into auto-versioned Docker images, auto built on webhook. Deploy single-use AWS instances for infinite capacity. 

Manage repositories on connected servers, which can perform automation via scripting / webhooks. 

Manage all your configuration / environment variables, with shared global variable and secret interpolation. 

Keep a record of all the actions that are performed and by whom.
